            One would think that only taste is decisive for a beer evaluation. But is this true? <br>
            Throughout our data story we will investigate how important other sensory features are and how they
            are influenced by external factors like culture.
            Moreover, we want to find out if our opinion may be influenced by environmental factors like
            the economy.<br>
            Join us on a malty journey to the definition of a good beer.

            When you’re asked to rate a beer, it might seem like a trivial task: 
            if you like it you give it a good rating and if you don’t you give it a bad rating, simple right? 
            But how you rate a beer can be affected by a plethora of factors that you are not necessarily aware of. 
            Have you ever stopped and wondered what factors can influence your rating of a particular brew? 
            Have you thought about which of your senses are most stimulated when you like a beer? 
            Or that perhaps your culture and environment have shaped your opinion about a beer?
            In this project, we will delve into the world of beer appreciation and examine both intrinsic and extrinsic 
            factors that can impact how one rates/reviews a beer. 
            We do so by using data from two beer rating websites: RateBeer and BeerAdvocate. 
            We first look into which senses affect most one’s overall perception of a beer. 
            Next, we look into how your location and culture can affect your preference of a beer geographically and in 
            what way. Finally, we look into how your environment, in the form of major events affecting your country, 
            can have an impact on how you review a beer. 
            So grab a pint, sit back, and join us as we delve into the world of beer ratings!

              Does your location and/or culture affect your beer rating?
            </h3>
            <p>
              Here, we wanted to investigate whether there is some sort of location bias to how you rate a beer. 
              In other words, do we tend to rate beers better because they are local (brewed in the same country 
              or state for the United States). To do so we started by looking at the relative proportions for very 
              well reviewed beers (defined here as having a rating > 4 out of 5) of users having the same location as the 
              brewery country (or state for the United States) versus users who do not have the same location as 
              the brewery:

            <p>
              So at first glance, we observe that for most of these countries the beers rated higher than 4 are 
              brewed out of their own country except for the United States, Belgium, Germany and England.

              The above plots show clearly more often than not that people tend to rate well beers that haven’t 
              been brewed in their countries/states. However, this is not enough to conclude that there is a bias 
              or not. Maybe two beers brewed in two completely different locations are similar in the style they 
              are brewed making people from a certain region like a lot those same two beers. 
              So we wanted to define a more precise measure of bias rather than using user locations and brewery 
              locations. 
              An element of a beer that gives us a much better idea of culture is the style of Beer/brewing. 
              For example, a person who has grown up in a region with a strong tradition of brewing a particular 
              style of beer, such as lagers or ales, may be more familiar and inclined to rate those styles more 
              favorably. Similarly, a person who has had limited exposure to a particular style of beer may be 
              less familiar with it and therefore less able to accurately rate it.
              In order to capture this idea and see if people from a same region are more inclined to rate like 
              the same beers, we define a cultural stamp per country. Essentially, it’s a vector defined per 
              country where each beer style has a weight associated to it. The higher the weight, the more a 
              country likes that particular style. We next perform K-means clustering on those vectors in order to 
              see if some regions cluster together for their style preferences:

              </ul>

              So indeed, we see that depending on the region where you are located, you will probably have a bias 
              towards a certain style of beer/brewing.
              Let’s see what users form these respective cluster regions have to say about their favorite styles 
              of beer:

              Intrinsic Factors in Beer Preferences: Insights from User Reviews and Ratings:
            </h3>
            <p>
              We’ll look how some regions/clusters perceive their most liked type of beer. We’ll do so by getting 
              most frequent words in the comments. We separated the latter into two groups: very well reviewed 
              (>4 out of 5) and poorly reviewed beers’ comments (<2 out of 5).

              3 of our 4 clusters have a preference for IPA. These are known for their hoppy, bitter flavor and 
              aroma, which is achieved by using large amounts of hops during the brewing process. Cluster 6 has a 
              preference for a subtype called American IPA, not surprising that it corresponds to the east coast 
              of the US. <br>
              In the following graphs, we chose to show the most frequent words for cluster 7, 
              which most likely represent Europe. They correspond to very well and poorly reviewed beers, 
              respectively.

              Negative terms appear more often. Light and sweet might not come as negative at first. 
              But for this variety of style it seems to be the case.
              Just by looking at those graphs, guessing the type isn’t so hard. We find the essence of an IPA: bitter, 
              hop, fruity, ...

              Only one group stands out by having a strong preference for Pale Lager. Those are light, crisp beers 
              with low to medium hop bitterness and subtle malt flavors, often served chilled and popular as a 
              refreshing drink. Most countries in this group stand in South America. <br>
              The following graphs show the most common words for cluster 10..  They, again, correspond to

              The presence of certain terms in reviews seems to be closely tied to the perceived taste of the 
              drink. We’ll check that hypothesis by correlating the rating of each feature of our dataset to 
              the overall rating. These are the following: appearance, aroma, palate taste. This correlation 
              test has been computed on the whole dataset, not only clusters.

              Taste has the highest R-value. Other factors, such as aroma, appearance, and palate, can also 
              contribute to our perception of a beer, but ultimately it is the taste itself that determines 
              whether we find a beer pleasing or not.

                <h3>
                  How Economics influence our opinion on beer: An analysis of the financial crisis of 2007/2008:
                </h3>
                <p>
                  Since a good part of the data was in the US (58%), our last part consists of analyzing how 
                  external major events in your country might influence how you review a beer.
                  To that end we focused on one of the most significant economic events in recent US history: 
                  the 2007-2008 financial crisis. During time of economic uncertainty, consumers may be more 
                  cautious of their spending which can in turn affect how they review a beer. This example was 
                  chosen to highlight how an extrinsic factor such as an economy or politics can affect 
                  the way people review beers.
                  We have the hypothesis that in times of crisis, the drop in incomes leads to a higher weighting 
                  of the factor price.
                  We assume that a factor with higher importance will be mentioned more often. So if the importance
                  of the feature price varies over time we should observe a higher or lower frequency in the text 
                  reviews.
                </p>

                <p>
                  From the 5.7 million reviews, 240'000 mention at least one price related word. The figure below
                  shows the total number of monthly reviews, the count of monthly reviews mentioning at least one price
                  related word or both. Note that the y-axis is logarithmic and not linear.

                  To be able to compare different month, we need the relative amount of price related reviews

                  The first signs of the financial crisis appeared in the beginning of 2007. However, apparently 
                  these signs were not sufficient to increase the weight of the factor price. <br>
                  We can see that the price related words start increasing around September 2008. 
                  This is the time when the bank "Lehman Brother" announced their bankruptcy and the crisis
                  spread around the world. <br>
                  Interestingly, after the "officially recognized" end of the crisis with the economic stimulation 
                  package in February 2009, it took two more years until the weight of price in beer reviews started 
                  to decrease again.
                  Note that the effect size is quite low. From 4% of reviews mentioning price in 2008 the value 
                  rises to 5% in 2011. So, even though significant, the change is quite small.

                <p>
                  We used Chi-Square testing to see for which time intervals the change in occurence of price related
                  reviews is statistically significant. <br>

                  The results show that there are periods with statistical significant changes, but these periods
                  are rather sparse. Interestingly, from 2008 until 2015 the changes are almost continously

                  Crisis is a pretty abstract term. So, we decided to compare our results with a more tangible 
                  factor, the unemployment (information about the data in <a href="#story-notes">footer</a>).<br>
                  The graph below shows both the evolution of the ratio of price related reviews and the evolution 
                  of unemployment in the US. <br>
                  In the upper half of the figure, green represents an increase in unemployment over time, while
                  red stands for a decrease. <br>
                  Following the same color code, in the lower half, increase and decrease of occurrence of price related
                  reviews is depicted.

                  We saw before that the time period of constant statistically significant changes is from 2008 
                  to 2015. So we will focus the analysis on this period of time.<br>
                  We can see that the tendency in change of price related reviews follows the tendency of the 
                  unemployment rate with approximately one year delay. <br>
                  So, most likely there is a correlation between the two factors which intuitively makes sense. <br>
                  When people lose their jobs they are more concerned about the price of the products they consume.
                  This delay could be due to unemployment insurance or due to financial reserves. <br>
                  As we only observe correlation and not causality, it is also possible that both events occur due 
                  to another factor that causes unemployment at some point and a higher weighting of price for beers
                  at another point in time. <br>

              Conclusion:
            </h3>
            <p>
              Little surprising is the result that taste is the most important sensory factor. But also, palate 
              and aroma are very important, although one can say that they are quite connected to taste. The 
              appearance has very little influence. <br>
              Our hypothesis that different cultural clusters could weight different sensory features in distinct 
              manners could not be shown with our approach. The weighting of the sensory factors was very similar 
              for all the investigated groups. <br>
              However, the external factor economy seems to correlate with factors that influence the rating of 
              beers. During the crisis price related words were mentioned more often in text reviews, which may 
              indicate a higher importance of the factor price during that period. <br><br>
              We have seen that there is a lot of theory around beer, but let's be honest, nothing beats practice.<br><br>
              So, prost to a project full of flavour and fun!

              <h5>Beer DataSet</h5>
  
              <p>
                The Beer DataSet that we used for our analysis contains users reviews on beer from two rating platforms:
                <a href="https://www.beeradvocate.com/">BeerAdvocate</a> and 
                <a href="https://www.ratebeer.com/beer-ratings/">RateBeer</a>. The set contains over 10 Million reviews 
                between 1996 to 2017. Available information are: beer name, style, brewery name, alcohol content,
                date of review, username of reviewer, a text-review (if given by user), a score for each of five 
                categories (appearance, aroma, palate, taste, overall). Moreover, there is information about 
                the country of origin of the user and the breweries.
              </p>

              <h5><a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/axeltorbenson/unemployment-data-19482021">Unemployment DataSet</a></h5>
                <p>
                  The unemployment dataset was obtained on kaggle and contains the monthly unemployment 
                  rate from 1948-2021. None of the data is seasonally adjusted. 
                  This file also contains information on subsets of the population, including 
                  based on age ranges from 16-55 and over, and unemployment rates for men and women. This 
                  data is collected by the US Bureau of Labor Statistics.

            In today’s era of technological innovation, students need to gain knowledge and skills in order to solve
            difficult problems, gather and evaluate evidence, make sense of information they study, and be prepared
            for the careers and challenges of the
            21<sup>st</sup> century and beyond. Students can develop and strengthen these skills by studying science,
            technology,
            engineering, and mathematics (STEM) subjects, including computer science (CS).<sup><a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"

            Mathematics has been called the “language” of STEM because students need a strong mathematics foundation
            to succeed in STEM fields and to make sense of STEM-related topics in their daily lives.<sup><a href="#_ftn2"

                [2]
              </a></sup> This story focuses
            on Algebra I within K-12 education because it is seen
            as a gatekeeper course: Students normally need to complete Algebra I in order to take higher level
            mathematics and science courses.<sup><a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title="">[3]</a></sup> Taking the course earlier in their academic careers allows students sufficient time to take
            the more advanced courses that are often prerequisites for postsecondary STEM majors. However, we see in
            this data story that
            only 24 percent of all 8<sup>th</sup> graders are enrolled in Algebra I. <a class="md-trigger more-info"

            This data story explores both access to and enrollment in Algebra I in K-12 public schools using the

            the students who actually enroll in these classes, particularly in 8<sup>th</sup> grade. The Department is
            encouraging
            both access to and enrollment in STEM courses. Both aspects are important because, as we will see through
            the story, even where access to Algebra I classes are available students do not necessarily enroll in them.

            When students take Algebra I matters, but many students do not have early
            access.

          <p>
            Despite the benefits of early access to Algebra I, we see that only 59 percent of schools that serve 8<sup>th</sup>
            graders offer Algebra I. A typical math course sequence would start with Algebra I and continue with
            Geometry, Algebra II,
            Pre-Calculus, and Calculus. Students who do not have access to Algebra I until high school are unlikely to
            have the opportunity to take any Calculus courses before they graduate.

            Since high-level mathematics and high-level science courses are frequently taken together, students who
            have the opportunity to take more advanced math courses are also more likely to take advanced science
            courses. When schools don’t offer Algebra I to
            8<sup>th</sup> graders, it can reduce the amount of all STEM courses - not just math courses - they can
            take
            before graduation.

            While 59 percent of schools offered Algebra I in 8<sup>th</sup> grade, these schools served 80 percent of
            8<sup>th</sup> grade students overall, meaning that four-fifths of all 8<sup>th</sup> graders attended a
            school that
            offered Algebra I. The percentage
            of 8<sup>th</sup> graders who had access to Algebra I was largest for students attending magnet schools,
            with nearly 90 percent of students having access to Algebra I in 8<sup>th</sup> grade, and lowest for
            students attending a special education
            school with nearly 20 percent of students having access to Algebra I in 8<sup>th</sup> grade. This wide variation
            shows that students’ access to STEM education can be greatly affected by the type of school they attend.

            About 86 percent of students in suburban areas (where the largest percentage of students are enrolled) had
            access to Algebra I in 8<sup>th</sup> grade, compared to about 75 percent of students in all other areas.
          </p>
          <p>
            Next we will explore how <em>access</em> to Algebra I differs from <em>enrollment</em> in Algebra I in 8<sup>th</sup>

            Enrollment lags behind access. Even when they can take Algebra I, many 8<sup>th</sup> graders do not.
          </h3>
          <p>
            While access to Algebra I is important, access alone is not enough. Students will not reap the benefits of
            <em>access</em> to more STEM courses if they are not actually <em>enrolled</em> in the courses.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are many factors within a school that may affect how many, and which, students are
            enrolled in Algebra I in 8<sup>th</sup> grade. For example, some students have access to Algebra
            I in 7<sup>th</sup> grade,
            some students may not be ready to take Algebra I in 8<sup>th</sup> grade, and others may not be interested

            Although over 8,000 districts offered access to Algebra I, in almost 90 percent of districts, less than
            half of all 8<sup>th</sup> graders were enrolled in the course. We also see differences in enrollment by
            state, with Minnesota and Pennsylvania,
            for example, standing out as states with broad enrollment. <a class="md-trigger more-info" data-modal="modal-5">Learn

            We know that a strong STEM education is a path to successful career and we know that the need for STEM
            knowledge and
            skills will continue to grow in the future.

              </a></sup> Taking Algebra I before high school, such as in 8<sup>th</sup> grade, can set students up for
            a strong
            foundation of STEM education and open the door for various college and career options.
          </p>
          <p>
            The data explored in this story highlight both successes and areas for improvement, as school leaders,
            teachers and parents across the country, work to ensure equal access to a strong STEM education for all
            students.

            <h5>Civil Rights Data Collection</h5>

            <p>
              The data explored in this story comes from the <a href="https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/crdc-2015-16.html">Civil Rights
                Data Collection (CRDC)</a>. Since 1968, the U.S. Department of Education (ED) has conducted the CRDC to
              collect data on key education and civil rights issues in our nation's public schools. The CRDC collects a
              variety of information including student enrollment and educational programs and services, most of which
              is disaggregated by race/ethnicity, sex, limited English proficiency, and disability. The CRDC informs
              the Office of Civil Rights’ overall strategy for administering and enforcing the civil rights statutes
              for which it is responsible. The CRDC collects data only
              from public schools and does not include data from private
              schools. To directly download the CRDC data files, click <a href="https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/2015-16-crdc-data.zip">here</a> (34MB).
            </p>

            <h5>Data Exclusion Rules</h5>
            <p>
              Data included in this story may differ slightly from other published reports due to certain data
              decisions. For the purposes of these analyses, schools with incomplete or inconsistent data values were
              excluded as follows:
            </p>
            <p>
              1. Less than 1% of schools were excluded from all analyses because they reported inconsistent data for
              Algebra I enrollment for the same grade level.
            </p>
            <p>
              2. An additional 6% of schools serving 8<sup>th</sup> grade students were excluded from all enrollment
              analyses due to missing 8<sup>th</sup> grade enrollment data or the 8<sup>th</sup> grade Algebra I
              enrollment count being larger than
              the 8<sup>th</sup> grade overall enrollment.
            </p>
            <p>
              3. Fewer than 10 schools were excluded from the enrollment by urbanicity (locale) analysis due to missing
              data.
            </p>
            <p>
              4. Schools with an 8<sup>th</sup> grade Algebra I enrollment count larger than the 8<sup>th</sup> grade
              enrollment for either the male or female subgroup (1% of schools serving 8th-grade students) were
              excluded from the enrollment by gender
              analysis.
            </p>
            <p>
              5. Schools with an 8<sup>th</sup> grade Algebra I enrollment count larger than the 8<sup>th</sup> grade
              enrollment for at least one race/ethnicity subgroup (16% of schools serving 8<sup>th</sup> grade
              students) were excluded from the enrollment
              by race/ethnicity analysis.
